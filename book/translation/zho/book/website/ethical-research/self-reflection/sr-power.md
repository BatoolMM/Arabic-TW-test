# Power and privilege

当考虑位置时 [{term}`def<Positionality>`], 重要的是要了解我们如何能够相对于我们所工作的人民拥有权力和特权。 我们正在研究的那些人的数据，以及我们正在努力解决的问题。 我们的权力和特权或压迫经历与我们的阶级经历密切交织在一起， 种族、性别和更多 {cite:ps}`crenshaw1989年去边缘化，整理黑色` 这些经验是必须考虑的，因为权力和特权的主题存在于我们所有的环境中。 Having privilege can make us unaware of related issues that do not directly affect us.

To illustrate, here are some examples of how power and privilege present as structural issues in data science:  
<!-- Welcome more examples here! -->
- **Racial injustice and patriarchal systems** have meant that data science has historically been dominated by white men. This means that there has not been a diverse group of people to direct the aims of data science work, and so many groups are likely to be overlooked when considering the negative impacts and potential benefits of data science.
- **The English language is the default** in many programming languages and academic settings, which creates barries to knowledge sharing and inclusion. Rather than English speakers learning other languages, it is generally expected that non-English speakers learn English in order to participate and collaborate, which frames English as the default.
- **Data science work can require huge amounts of energy and computational power**, which disproportionality affects the lives of people living in the places most affected by climate change. These countries tend to already be economically disadvantaged relative to others, and have less access to the resources needed to manage the impacts of climate change.

Broader structural aspects of power and privilege can seem too big to counter on our own, but they also play out in individual interactions where we have much more control. By understanding systems and structures of power and oppression, and where we sit within them, we can better identify where change needs to happen, and what we can do to contribute to that change.

## Intersectionality

Intersectionality [{term}`def<Intersectionality>`] is an important concept to know and understand when thinking about power, privilege and identity.

The term **intersectionality** refers to how multiple identities can intersect, and so people can be oppressed on the basis of combinations of their identities instead of, or as well as, their separate identities. 金伯利·克伦沙乌教授于1989年在 {cite:ps}`crenshaw1989年取消了边缘化` 这个词是用来描述分别保护黑人和妇女的法律的方式。 However, Black women were not by default protected against discrimination that exclusively affected Black women. Now, the term 'intersectionality' has become more widely used and broadly refers to how people are often disadvantaged by multiple sources of oppression.

Intersectionality has sometimes incorrectly been assumed to be a way of making a 'heirarchy of oppression', which is not its purpose. We must recognise that power and privilege is a case of _both/and_ rather than _either/or_. This means that someone may be privileged in one way, and disadvantaged in another.
