# Guide for Reproducible Research

***This guide covers topics related to skills, tools and best practices for research reproducibility.***

_The Turing Way_ defines reproducibility in data research as data and code being available to fully rerun the analysis.

There are several definitions of reproducibility in use, and we discuss these in more detail in the {ref}`rr-overview-definitions` section of this chapter. While it is absolutely fine for us each to use different words, it will be useful for you to know how _The Turing Way_ defines *reproducibility* to avoid misunderstandings when reading the rest of the handbook.

_The Turing Way_ started by defining reproducibility in the context of this handbook, laying out its importance for science and scientists, and providing an overview of the common concepts, tools and resources. 前几章是关于 {ref}`版本控制<rr-vcs>`, {ref}`测试<rr-testing>`, 和 {ref}`可复现的计算环境<rr-renv>` 自该项目于2019年开始以来，100多个捐助方撰写、编辑、审查、阅读和宣传了许多其他章节。 Since the start of this project in 2019, many additional chapters have been written, edited, reviewed, read and promoted by over 100 contributors.

We welcome your contributions to improve these chapters, add other important concepts in reproducibility, and empower researchers to work reproducibly from the start. Check out our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get involved.
