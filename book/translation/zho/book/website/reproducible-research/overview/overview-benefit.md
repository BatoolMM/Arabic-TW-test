# Added Advantages

In the {ref}`rr-overview-definitions` section, we discussed the different aspects of reproducible research that are beneficial for the scientific community. 在本章中，我们将分享一些不太明显的方面，为个别研究人员和团队再复制工作。 In this chapter, we will share some less obvious aspects of working reproducibly for individual researchers and teams.

An illustration of reasons why we should care about working reproducibly.

**1. 1. 跟踪您研究的完整历史**

Reproducible research must contain a complete history and narrative (also known as [Provenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance)) of the project planning and development process. This includes information on the data, tools, methods, codes, and documentation used in the research project. By storing a complete track-record of our work, we can ensure research sustainability, fair citation/acknowledgement, and usefulness of our and others' work in our research fields.

**2. 2. 促进协作和审查进程**

By designing reproducible workflows and sharing them with the different components of our research project, we can allow others to develop an in-depth understanding of our work. This encourages them to review our methods, test our code, propose useful changes and make thoughtful contributions to develop our project further. Reproducible workflows facilitate the peer review process tremendously by allowing reviewers access to the different parts of the projects that are necessary to validate the research outcomes.

**3. 3. 发布已验证的研究并避免错误信息**

Lack of reproducibility is one of the major factors that lead to paper retractions (source [Retraction Watch](https://retractionwatch.com/)). 对心理 {cite:ps}`2012年初` 癌症生物学 {cite:ps}`2015年公开科学合作复发性` 最著名的科学文献分析发现，其研究产出的复发率约为40%和10%。 By working reproducibly, we can develop validated research work, avoid misinformation that can limit replicability of our work and publish accurate research outputs. This aspect does not only support the validity of the current work, but any future studies that are based on reproducible research {cite:ps}`MozillaScienceLab`.

**4. 4. 高效率地编写您的文件、论文和报告**

Well documented analyses help us maintain easy access to all the results generated within a project that can be written up efficiently. If working in a team, collaborators can easily get recognition in terms of authorship for their contributions. Furthermore, by availing the underlying dataset and methods we can easily comply with the highest-level journal guidelines.

**5. 5. 公平获取您工作的积分**

Applying reproducibility practices separately on different parts of the project such as data, independently executable codes and scripts, protocols, and reports allow other researchers to test and reuse our work in their research and brings fair recognition for our work. Researchers who publish their work with the underlying information, get cited more often as their research outcome can be broadly replicated and trusted. This fair credit system encourages researchers to further maintain reproducibility practices in their work.

**6. 6. 确保您工作的连续性**

By following guidelines for reproducibility, we can easily communicate our work with different stakeholders such as our supervisors, funders, reviewers, students, and potential collaborators. 可再生产的这个方面使其他人能够很容易地利用我们的结果，从而增加我们研究的效用。 并重新使用我们的研究材料 {cite:ps}`Mozilla Science实验室` 这确保了研究构想的连续性，甚至可以在其他情况下找到新的应用。 This ensures the continuity of a research idea and can even find fresh applications in other contexts. Progress of such projects can easily be tracked and continued - either by other researchers, or yourself if you want to build on your own work after a longer period {cite:ps}`Markowetz2015`.
