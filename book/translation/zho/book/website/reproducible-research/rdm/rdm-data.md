## What is Data?

Data are objects that you use and produce during your research life cycle, encompassing datasets, software, code, workflow, models, figures, tables, images and videos, interviews, articles. Data are your research asset. In some fields, it is obvious what data means - you have observations or results of simulations. However, in other fields, particularly in Social Sciences, Humanities or Arts, you may be thinking "I do not think I have any data". 对哪些数据可能被归类为需要管理的一种很好的思考方法，就是向自己提出问题：“我需要在我的文件或书籍中使用和写什么信息？ ，“我需要哪些资料来支持我的结论？ 和“他人需要哪些信息来理解并可能复制我已经进行的研究？” 此信息是您的数据。 This information is your data.

## The Research Data Lifecycle - A Model for Data Management

研究数据常常跟随研究项目的进化。 这里是描述它的 [视频](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wjFMMQD3UA)。 This model provides a sound basis on which to plan for research data management, from data creation at the start of a research project, through to publishing and sharing research at the end of the project, and archiving any research data for the long-term and future re-use once the project has ended.

The research data lifecycle involves data creation, data use, data publication and sharing, data archiving, and data re-use or destruction. However, data have a longer lifespan than the research project that creates them. In a  {ref}`Data Management Plan <rr-rdm-dmp>` you can structure how you will manage and share your research data.
