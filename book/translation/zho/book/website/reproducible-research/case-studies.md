# Case Studies: Reproducible Research

## Prerequisites / recommended skill level

This chapter assumes familiarity with several topics covered in this {ref}`rr`. Since not all examples will demonstrate the use of the same combinations of methods covered in this guide, the prerequisite and skill level will vary across the case studies. Therefore, we recommend the authors to indicate those skills for each case study separately.
