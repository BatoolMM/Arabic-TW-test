## Summary

Code review provides an additional way of testing code quality. Instead of relying simply on {ref}`tests<rr-testing>` which the original author puts together themselves, code review gets another programmer to look over the new code and assess it. The goal is to point out strengths and also potential areas of improvement.

Code review is often done in pairs, with each reviewer also having some of their code reviewed by their partner. Doing this can help programmers to see and discuss issues and alternative approaches to tasks, and to learn new tips and tricks. 这也意味着代码审查做法特别适合于一个以上贡献者进行改变的项目。 Nonetheless, even the smallest scale projects can harness these approaches with some creative project management.

Because of their nature, code reviews act as qualitative - rather than quantitative - tests but are no less valuable for that.

This section will provide an overview of rationales, best practices, and some possible workflows for code review. Some details refer specifically to GitHub's code review functionality as a powerful and widely-used example of a formal code review system; however, equivalent and very similar systems are available elsewhere (for example, [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com)), and even informal code review practices can also be very beneficial to a project.
