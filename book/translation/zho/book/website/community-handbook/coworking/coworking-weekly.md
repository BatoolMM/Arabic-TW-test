# Weekly Coworking Calls

_The Turing Way_ team has been hosting shorter coworking calls each week. These calls are similar to the Collaboration Cafes, but only 1-hour long. Since May 2020, these calls have been taking place multiple days each week at 11:00 GMT/BST. It is not hosted on the days when there is a Collaboration Cafe already scheduled.

Like Collaboration Cafes, we host these calls online using [Zoom](https://www.zoom.us/). We use the Shut up & Write! method by providing allocated time for two 20-25 minutes long Pomodoro sessions and two short breaks to chat about our work and exchange what we got done.

The primary target of these calls are members who are working on certain issues or PRs in _The Turing Way_ to come along and join other community members in their usual working hours. These calls also provide opportunities to clarify doubts about the project, get PRs reviewed, brainstorm different ideas together, and stay connected with other members in the community.

## Attending an online coworking call

The schedule for these coworking calls is updated weekly [community calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=theturingway%40gmail.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon). We announce these in our [monthly newsletters](https://tinyletter.com/TuringWay/archive) and send a reminder every Monday on the [Slack channel](https://tinyurl.com/jointuringwayslack).

Though scheduled for 1 hour, you are welcome to join for shorter period as your schedule allows, however, please let the host of the call know so that they know who to expect on the call. If you are interested in coworking with one of the team members on a day that is not listed on the schedule, please contact them on Slack or by email so that they can find a common slot to work with you.

### Resource used for the call

The resource requirement for these calls is also very similar to the Collaboration Cafe.

1. 由 [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/)分享的备注: [https://hackmd.io/@turingway/coworking-calling](https://hackmd.io/@turingway/coworking-call)
2. Online call by [Zoom](https://www.zoom.us/): The Zoom link is provided in the HackMD.
3. An online Pomodoro clock: [https://cuckoo.team/TW-coworking](https://cuckoo.team/TW-coworking)

We don't record these calls. We also don't create {ref}`breakout rooms<ch-coworking-collabcafe-breakout>` unless there are multiple people working on same things.

### Format of the call

We have a template for the {ref}`Collaboration Cafes<ch-template-coworking-weekly>`, which is updated on the [shared HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@malvikasharan/TW-coworking) for each week.

We'll run the following schedule during each call:

| Duration | Activity                                |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Start    | 👋 Welcome                               |
| 5 mins   | Introductions and personal goal setting |
| 25 mins  | 🍅 1st Pomodoro session                  |
| 5 mins   | ☕️ Break and report out                 |
| 25 mins  | 🍅 2nd Pomodoro session                  |
| 5 mins   | Open discussion and Close 👋             |

In contrast to the Collaboration Cafes, the schedule for these calls seems more intense with less chance for discussion. However, since these calls are attended by fewer participants, it provides more opportunities for informal interactions.

### Chairing Coworking calling

请使用以下步骤每月更新文档：

- [每月更新HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@turingway/coworking-call) ，增加每周通话的日期
- 将笔记从前调用到模板区域下方(将会定期存档于本节点页面)
- 在Slack和Twitter上分享笔记，宣布日期
- 通话期间使用便笺，在您主持通话时分享信息
- 请确保您共享行为守则链接并使用共享的 Cuckoo (或其他网络时钟)
- 在开始番茄钟会话之前为人们创建分区房间——需要时
- 随着第一个番茄钟结束, 关闭任何分房间, 要求反馈, 然后重启第二个番茄会议
- 通话排定时间为60分钟，因此最多可以容纳2个番茄会议
- 关闭通话，感谢所有人，并为下一次通话腾出笔记

#### Beginning

这次呼吁首先是小组成员欢迎与会者，分享《行为守则》，提醒他们如何参与呼吁， 并为每个人分享他们正在做的事情和他们将要做的事情奠定基础。

#### Pomodoros

会话主席将启动 [计时器](https://cuckoo.team/TW-coworking) 来跟踪番茄钟的会话。 如果每个人都计划就独立的任务开展工作，我们就会留在主会议室，静悄悄地工作。 对于呼叫中的两个人正在进行的任何讨论或协作任务，我们将为他们创建 [个断开房间](#breakout-rooms)。

如果有新成员在通话中， 其中一名成员(通常是电话主页)将把新成员带到一个分区房间，在项目仓库周围展示并分享一些开始的小贴士。

#### Breaks

我们将在每个番茄钟后短暂休息，思考我们可以做些什么。 任何参与者可能会遇到的错误，我们都会对我们的进展表示欢迎，并庆祝小的成功。

#### If joining this call later

如果你稍后加入，你可能会看到一些人静悄悄地从事他们的任务。 您可以在您的浏览器中打开 [共享时钟](https://cuckoo.team/TW-coworking) 来跟踪下次休息之前的时间。 如果你事先知道你以后加入， 您可以通过在通话前联系他们或在共享文档中留下笔记来让主机知晓。
