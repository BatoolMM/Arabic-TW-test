# Application and Review Process

The application, review, and selection process have been developed to provide a fair opportunity for all the interested members to show their interest in attending our book dash events.

In this subchapter, we have provided details on the book dash's application and reviewing process.

## Call for applications

这本书破折号活动由最多15名参与者组织。 The event is divided into multiple sessions with small groups of participants attending in their time zone. This allows the core team members to offer specific mentorship to the invited participants and make this an interactive, intimate, fun, and productive event.

为了公平地作出这一选择，至少提前3个月开始申请，以便感兴趣的成员能够分享他们的技能。 通过一个简短的应用程序，了解到的兴趣和预期结果。 The applications are kept open for a minimum of 4 weeks and the timeline is communicated clearly through our newsletters, Twitter feed, and application form.

This application can take 30-45 minutes to complete. We have created this template document with all the questions to prepare a draft before submission: https://tinyurl.com/tw-bookdash-template.

我们继续考虑如何确保隐私和数据保护。 目前，所有这些答复都是根据 [GDRPR (一般数据保护条例)法律](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) (学习如何创建 [GDPR防伪调查](https://www.surveylegend.com/gdpr/how-to-make-gdpr-proof-surveys-or-forms/) )安全处理的。 All our applicants must agree with the following GDPR statement when sending their application:
> *我们需要存储您的电子邮件地址来联系您。 The information provided in this form will be shared only with The Turing Way Book Dash organisers to help them review your application fairly. 所有提供的详细信息都将存储在谷歌驱动器中，只有 _的核心成员能够访问_ Ting Way 。 服务器以美国为基地。 您可以随时从我们的数据库中删除您的电子邮件地址和其他可识别信息。 如果您有任何疑问，请通过发送邮件给turingway@gmail.com联系团队成员。 You may edit your responses after submission until 21 May 2022. Please select the "I understand and I accept" option before proceeding.*

We ask if applicants have previously participated in a Book Dash so that they can express their interest to join the Book Dash review and planning committee for this event:
> We encourage returning applicants to The Turing Way Book Dash to join the planning committee. They will take on advisory and leading roles for the Book Dash events in 2022 by getting involved in application Review, selection process, organisation meeting, session host and mentorship or accessibility-related support they can offer based on their willingness, availability and interest. For any questions, please email theturingway@gmail.com.

每个申请人以150个字回答下列问题：
- 你能够为诱惑的道路做些什么？
- 你作为诱导方式书的一部分会从中得到什么好处？

We ask an optional question for returning members to express their interest to take on leadership roles in designing and organising Book Dashes:
- 申请人是否回答了申请问题？

这些对申请表中问题的答复有助于我们挑选一群人，他们将能够有效地一道工作，并为之做出一系列广泛的贡献。 我们不期望候选人以前可能曾为该项目作出贡献，或熟悉我们的项目基础设施，例如基特哈布的贡献。 我们想更多地了解他们认为对其他人在目前情况下从事数据科学的重要和有益的想法。

然后我们提出几个人口问题。 我们想要确保选定的参与者群带来多种技能、知识和经验到 _诱导之路_。 我们的目标是让来自不同群体的成员参与，特别是那些传统上因性别、族裔和职业阶段而被排除在数据科学之外的成员。 因此，我们请我们的申请人表明他们是否认为自己是历史上代表性不足的一个或多个集团的成员。 在这里，他们可以添加任何其他信息，说明他们认为核心小组在审查他们的申请时应该知道的(例如LGBTQ+, 移民，残疾人，父母，照顾人，POC 会员）。

我们力求消除可能妨碍我们的与会者参加这次活动的任何障碍。 因此，我们使用这一表格来评估我们能够提供哪些支助，包括供资要求。 我们的与会者确保他们能够舒适地参加活动。 申请人可以提到他们的旅行、住宿、儿童保育和参与的无障碍条件。

Finally, we provide details regarding the event schedule and ask our applicants to indicate which time slots for collaborative co-working and social sessions would work for their time zones.

## Reviewing process

_的应用程序诱惑路径_ 预订破折号由至少2个 _的成员审核_ 核心团队审阅。 A response form created by the organising members using the rubrics described below, the response from which are shared among all the reviewers during a designated meeting between the panel members. 每项标准的评分在1至3之间，3=标准完全符合，2=标准部分符合，1=标准没有达到。 为了避免个人偏见，下文对审评答复表中的每个问题都明确界定了每个得分。 这个标题旨在评估该应用的多个方面，避免小组成员可能有的任何个人偏见。

### Rubrics for scoring applications

根据它们对申请的评价，它们将为不同的标准提供评分，这些评分将按以下方式进行评估：

我们请我们的审查人员考虑以下问题：

* Has the applicant answered the application questions?
* 申请人是否有一个清楚、可行和相关的想法，说明他们将如何为书籍作出贡献？    这个分数一般相当于分别对“未准备好”、“热情”和“明确”的评分：
* 申请者是否热衷于可再生性和 _诱惑方式_ 的目的？


(这个评分图形基于Mozilla 开放领袖和开放生命科学选择标准)
1. 得分 **最多1秒** 的申请者没有一个明确的想法/话题可供贡献或者对 _的总体目标没有明确的了解。</li>
2 Applicants who score **mostly 2s** are enthusiastic if not wholly suitable for the project/event, for example, they may come with some ideas for a contribution that is currently not in the scope of the project/event.
3 Applicants who score **mostly 3s** are clearly ready, goal-oriented, interested in contributing to the project, and excited to learn from others at the event.</ol>

**表格概括了我们每个得分的标本和标准：**

*This scoring rubric is based on the Mozilla Open Leaders and Open Life Science (OLS) selection criteria as described in the 'Review Rubrics' on [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/open-life-science/application-forms).*

| **Readiness for the book dash event**                                     | (not ready) Does not provide enough information or seems to misunderstand the nature of _The Turing Way_ project and this event in general                                                                        | (enthusiastic) Seems to have a clear understanding of _The Turing Way_ project and this event and brings along a specific content for contributions                                                           |                                                                                (clear) Seems to have a clear understanding of the Turing Way project and this event and a clear understanding of how they can contribute and collaborate with each other at this event |
| **Goals for the project contributions:**                                  | (not ready) Shares vague or general ideas that are unrelated to _The Turing Way_ project and this event, or no goals at all                                                                                       | (enthusiastic) Shares clear, overly ambitious ideas for _The Turing Way_ project and this event that can likely be refined in a collaboration cafe, or the day before the event during the brainstorm session |                                                                                  (clear) Shares clear, achievable contribution/development ideas for this event that fits _The Turing Way_ project and are likely to be achieved through the applicant’s participation |
| **Purpose of participation and what they will get out of the book dash:** | (not ready) Purposes for participation at the book dash seem almost entirely self-centered and about the applicant’s status, rather than about participating in _The Turing Way_ community to develop the project | (enthusiastic) Purposes for the participation at the book dash event are not completely clear from the application or are limited (even though useful), such as typo or bug fixing                            | (clear) Purposes for participation at the book dash event are valuable in many ways and are likely to help the applicant to become an active contributor and take ownership of their work in _The Turing Way_ project and in the broader ecosystem in their own rights |
| **Willingness to collaborate and contribute after the book dash:**        | 看起来不允许合作性的工作方式或只对数据科学、研究或相关主题的某个方面更感兴趣。                                                                                                                                                                           | (enthusiastic) Seems excited to learn from others and _The Turing Way_ project, but in a general way without much understanding of what those things mean yet                                                 |                                                                                                                                                          (clear) Seems excited to collaborate with others and is motivated to contribute to _The Turing Way_ community |

还要求审查人员披露是否有任何利益冲突可能对其审查产生影响，导致其决定中的任何偏差。

我们请所有审查人员通过描述应用程序来完成审查。 在甄选小组就这些问题进行讨论时，应考虑到申请人的意见和评分的动机。

```
- Please highlight any diversity/minority groups this applicant belong to, that should be represented at this event
- Please provide 1-2 summary sentences about this application to facilitate discussion during the selection panel
```

Reviewers are also asked to disclose if any conflict of interest may have influenced their review leading to any bias in their decision.

```
- Please state if you have any conflict of interest with the proposal described in this application or do you know this applicant personally that may lead to a biased decision
```

最后，还要问审查人员是否会建议申请人。 可用的答案是“否”、“是”、“不确定”或“请求在面板中进行公开讨论”。 所有审评员中被评分为“否”或“不确定”的候选人将被拒绝。 所有其他候选人将在甄选小组中讨论。
