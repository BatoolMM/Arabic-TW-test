# Record of Contributions

Two documents in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) are used for creating a record of contributions in _The Turing Way_: Contributors Table in the [`README`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/README.md) file, and [`contributors.md`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/contributors.md) file. This record is made available in the afterword of this book as {ref}`Contributors<contributors-record-contributors>` and {ref}`Personal Highlights<contributors-record-highlights>`. These documents can be used for highlighting skills that our members have gained and shared through their involvement in _The Turing Way_.

We invite all our members to co-create this record to capture the important work they do around answering questions, representing the project, developing and maintaining the infrastructure, and all other nurturing roles that make The Turing Way community so special.

The process of developing this record is described below in detail.

## 1. 1. 贡献者表

The [Contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way#contributors) table in [`README`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/README.md) file is updated with every contributor's name using the [all contributors bot](https://allcontributors.org/)'s [emoji key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key).

No contribution is too small, and these emojis allow us to recognise and fairly acknowledging all kinds of contributions our community members make to the project. Those contributions can include (but are not limited to) bug fixing, chapter planning, writing, editing, reviewing, idea generation, presentation, project management, and maintenance. Please see the subchapter {ref}`Acknowledgement Examples <ch-acknowledgement-examples>` for details.

## 2. 2. 贡献者文件

The contributors file, called [`contributors.md`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/contributors.md) in the GitHub repository, will hold specific details provided by community members regarding their involvements in the project. This will be referred to as `contributor's detail` in the rest of this document:

> `贡献者姓名` * 角色： `这是任何特定贡献者在项目中承担的角色的可选条目。 It is also a place to mention the date/year since a contributor has taken this role. 例如，“核心贡献者（2018年至今）”、翻译牵头（2020年）或行为守则委员会成员（2019-2020年）。 ` * GitHub id: `GitHub id, 例如：[@kirstiejane](http://github. om/kirstiejane` * ORCID： `贡献者的ORCID，例如： [0000-0001-8498-4059](https://orcid)。 rg/0000-0001-8498-4059)` * 短生物： `1-2句关于自己的`

Then, our contributors will add "Personal highlights", which will hold details of their contributions to _The Turing way_:
> * Personal highlights: `GitHub contributions, PRs and issues. 更多细节已在下面讨论。 `

Additionally, contributors can opt to add more information they think can help them share their work and engagement with _The Turing Way_ project by supplementing "More information":
> * More information: `Additional information provided by the contributors. 这是可选的。 `

### Personal highlights

Specifications for all types of contributions made towards _The Turing Way_ can be added in the [contributors file](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/contributors.md) as personal highlights.

These highlights can be individually decided by the contributors to record what they consider to be their significant and useful for their personal profile. This can be supplemented with supporting materials such links to chapters, pull request, issues, and blog posts.

这一记录可以直接转化为我们社区成员的职业发展。 可以进一步用来提高个人或专业投资组合(简介、CV、续刊)(参见
