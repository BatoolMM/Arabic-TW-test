# Contributor Pathways

In this subchapter, we have developed personas in order to understand how new members might experience their first interactions with an online project and what "pathways" they are likely to take to get further involved as contributors.

The interactions with the project followed by the sustained engagements in a project can be understood in the following different phases of community membership:

1. Discovery - How they first hear about the project or group.
2. First Contact - How they first engage with the project or group, their initial interaction.
3. Participation - How they first participate or contribute.
4. Sustained Participation - How their contribution or involvement can continue.
5. Networked Participation - How they may network within the community.
6. Leadership - How they may take on some additional responsibility on the project, or begin to lead.

下面提供的例子包括 _的人。 导入_ 的技巧以及基于他们作为阅读者对项目的初步约定的用户和贡献者。 学习者、资源开发者、审核者和维护者。 These personas are created based on GitHub skills and willingness of the community members to contribute to the project.

For each persona, we highlight how their involvement with _The Turing Way_ can improve and enrich the project and community. This document is meant to suggest ways you might interact with, learn from, and contribute to _The Turing Way_. We hope that one of these personas resonates with you and motivates you to get involved!

## Contributor personas

1. Sam, someone who has no GitHub experience
2. Alia, someone who has a lot of GitHub experience
3. Amal, someone who knows they want to contribute and does
4. Noor, someone who doesn't know they want to contribute, but does
5. Robin, someone who can only contribute outside of their normal working hours

### 1. 1. Sam, 一个没有GitHub 经验的博士学生

Sam is a PhD student in biology at University College London. They are learning how to code in Python, but have not yet had any training in version control or GitHub. They're interested in learning how to use open notebooks such as Jupyter to do their analysis so that they can easily share their work for critique with their very busy supervisor.

1. **Discovery** - Sam hears about _The Turing Way_ Book Dash events through an email from the department's Open Science Champion.
2. **First Contact** - Sam checks out the GitHub repository to learn more about the project and see what skills are needed that they may be able to contribute.
3. **Participation** - They attend the London Book Dash, accepted for their enthusiasm to learn how to make their PhD research reproducible. They participate in the discussions, read existing chapters, and scroll through issues to see where they can contribute.
4. **Sustained Participation** - After gaining experience with GitHub through submitting pull requests and issues during the Book Dash, Sam is empowered to continue contributing to the online discussion and suggesting topics for the book, as well as editing and reviewing existing chapters by applying them to his research.
5. **Networked Participation** - They encourage some of their fellow PhD students to read _The Turing Way_ and start using GitHub.
6. **Leadership** - Sam submits one of their research projects as a case study for _The Turing Way_.

### 2. 2. Alia，Git/GitHub 经验和书籍主题专长的研究人员

Alia是摩洛哥的一个邮政公司，它在RB中实施方案。 他们热衷于开放的数据，并很好地使用数据，但也能理解它比这更复杂。 They attend data science meetups in the city but are interested in finding a community working towards improving how research is conducted. They have experience with GitHub and contributing to open projects.

1. **Discovery** - Alia first hears about _The Turing Way_ via Twitter ([#TuringWay](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TuringWay&src=typed_query)).
2. **First Contact** - They land on the project's README and look for the contributing guidelines to see where their skills can be applied.
3. **Participation** - They find an issue asking for help on writing the Credit for Reproducible Research chapter and add a few paragraphs on how to properly cite research software.
4. **Sustained Participation** - After constructive feedback and collaboration with _The Turing Way_ team, Alia follows the community on social media and attend the online Collaboration Cafe.
5. **Networked Participation** - They invite other friends and colleagues from the Rstats community to get involved, who have expertise on some of the book topics.
6. **Leadership** - Alia volunteers to write the chapter on "Scoping a data project for RSEs" that they found requested in the [Book Skeleton](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/book_skeleton.md).

### 3. 3. Amal博士，博士主管，是可再生研究方面的专家

Amal is a PhD supervisor who is an expert in running risk assessments for projects using reproducible research. They are always looking for opportunities to share their expertise, particularly with students, as they think the consistent application of best practice is important. They are very keen to collaborate with people and to volunteer their time for collaboration projects. They like seeing their work make an impact and are keen to know about the eventual result of their collaborations.

1. **Discovery** - Amal finds out about _The Turing Way_ book from the Twitter feed of experts in reproducible research who they follow.
2. **First Contact** - Amal navigates to the GitHub repository and reads the content there over a couple of days. While reading, they make notes on areas they could add to from their research.
3. **Participation** - They compile their work into a chapter format and submit it to the repo.
4. **Sustained Participation** - Amal checks back frequently to look at feedback on their chapter and respond to it. In their spare time, they make suggestions and edits on other chapters.
5. **Networked Participation** - Amal directs students to their chapter in the _The Turing Way_ when they ask about risk assessments in reproducible research, and begins to direct students to other chapters as part of their teaching.
6. **Leadership** - Amal promotes _The Turing Way_  at their institution, suggesting to other academics that they get involved with its creation and adopt it as best practice.

### 4. 4. 不，一名正在努力完成其论文的博士生，

Noor is a final-year PhD student who has their dissertation deadline coming up. They are feeling the pressure of needing to write up the results of their research but finding it easy to procrastinate. They are confident that their research has taught them some particular considerations for reproducible environments, but they are slightly intimidated by the expertise of other people in their field, and they are considering their future after their PhD.

1. **Discovery** - Noor comes across _The Turing Way_ when they're surfing Twitter while trying to write up their research.
2. **First Contact** - They read the chapter that's relevant to their research and then continue working on their dissertation.
3. **Participation** - Later, Noor returns to _The Turing Way_ and makes some suggestions and edits to that chapter.
4. **Sustained Participation** - They return to the repo periodically to read feedback on their commits and make additional comments, restricted to the one chapter they feel they know about.
5. **Networked Participation** - Noor tweets a link to _The Turing Way_ during a conversation about reproducible research and retweets a response from another expert which leads to a longer conversation.
6. **Leadership** - After submitting their PhD, and unsure what they want to do next, Noor volunteers to co-ordinate further research into the chapter by reaching out to experts in the space.

### 5. 5. Robin，工业数据科学家
