name: the turing way acknowledgement
alt: The image shows the current system of acknowledgement with many people holding up one person. Then the Turing Way recognises all contributors as we think all need to be acknowledged equally so we have everyone standing at the same level. It also shows a robot to represent the all-contributors bot and people writing on their contributors file.

## Motivation and Background
The academic landscape is rapidly changing in favour of research projects involving large collaborations and interdisciplinary teams. This makes decisions concerning academic authorship hard to navigate and especially the need to consider different types of contributions fairly. Consequently, there is a shift in how researchers are thinking about assigning authorship for research outputs and what types of contributions are recognised and therefore valued.
